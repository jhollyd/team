How to Use generate_schedule.py:
Input: The function expects a dictionary (e.g., student_schedules) in the format generated by extract_ics.py, which contains the class schedule data.
Output: The function will return a list of generated schedules, each containing events formatted for FullCalendar.

For example:
# Mock input from extract_ics.py
student_schedules = {
    'student_id': '12345678',
    'class_schedule': [
        [930, 90, 'MO,WE'],  # Class at 9:30 AM for 90 minutes on Monday and Wednesday
        [1200, 60, 'TU,TH']  # Class at 12:00 PM for 60 minutes on Tuesday and Thursday
    ]
}

# Generate 20 draft schedules
schedules = generate_draft_schedules(student_schedules, num_schedules=20)
