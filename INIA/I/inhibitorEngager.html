    <h1>INIA’s Inhibitor/Engager Mechanism</h1>
    <p>The Inhibitor/Engager Mechanism in bioelectronic medicine refers to the use of non-invasive stimulation technologies to modulate immune responses by either inhibiting or engaging specific biological pathways. This approach is useful in neuromodulation therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</p>
    
    <p>The Inhibitor Mechanism works by suppressing excessive immune activity, which helps reduce inflammation and prevent conditions such as organ transplant rejection and autoimmune disorders. It employs ultrasound or electrical stimulation to lower pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6. This mechanism specifically targets the vagus nerve and other key neural pathways involved in immune regulation.</p>
    
    <p>In contrast, the Engager Mechanism activates immune pathways to enhance immune function, which is particularly beneficial for immunodeficiency disorders or chronic infections. It stimulates immune cells to increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, which aids in tissue repair and promotes homeostasis.</p>
  
    <p>INIA Biosciences integrates the Inhibitor/Engager Mechanism into its non-invasive, ultrasound-based device for immune modulation. Their system monitors biomarkers such as inflammation levels and dynamically adjusts stimulation parameters to either inhibit or engage immune activity as needed. This adaptive approach helps reduce reliance on immunosuppressants in transplant patients and individuals with inflammatory diseases. By offering real-time, drug-free immune regulation, INIA's technology presents a promising alternative for managing immune-related conditions.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-Invasive Ultrasound Therapy:</strong> Uses targeted sound waves to stimulate neural pathways that regulate immune function without requiring surgery or implanted devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Closed-Loop Monitoring:</strong> Continuously monitors biomarkers (e.g., inflammation levels) and adjusts stimulation parameters for personalized immune modulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Dual Functionality (Inhibitor & Engager):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>When inflammation is too high, the device suppresses cytokine overproduction, reducing symptoms in conditions like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant rejection.</li>
                <li>When immune function is too low, it enhances cytokine production to improve immune responses in chronic infections or immunodeficiency disorders.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>At-Home Administration:</strong> Unlike biologic drugs or immunosuppressants that require hospital visits or injections, INIA’s device is designed for easy, at-home use, making immune therapy more accessible and convenient.</li>
    </ul>
