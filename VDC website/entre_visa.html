            <h1>Entrepreneur Visa Sponsorship</h1>
            <h2>Visa Support</h2>
            <p>If you become a Global Entrepreneur-in-Residence at the VDC, 
                <em><strong>you can obtain a cap-exempt H-1B visa, sponsored by the University 
                of Massachusetts, anytime during the year.</em></strong> You work 8 hours per week 
                at the VDC mastering the company building process and sharing your 
                expertise with entrepreneurial peers, faculty and students. During the program, 
                you will document your extraordinary talent and ability, and advance your company, 
                so you can obtain a longer-term visa independent of the University of Massachusetts. 
                Your company will also advance through thoughtful and meaningful business mentorship, 
                connections and resources including offices, laboratories, and equipment. Backed by our 
                years of experience and expertise.</p>
